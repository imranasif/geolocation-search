***What's your proudest achievement?***

After moving from EEE, when i first started my coding life as a profeesional it was really difficult to get a real job.So i decided to do a small travel application on my own. Initially it was really hard to implement a service oriented codebase. It took around 3-4 months to write the whole system from scratch. While doing that project i studied lot of books, pages and projects. That project gave me an incredible satisfaction and at the end offered me a way to a prestigious job.
